        <h2>Computer history</h2>
        <p>
            The history of the computer began with ancient calculating tools like the abacus, evolving through mechanical calculators by Blaise Pascal and Gottfried Leibniz, to Charles Babbage's 19th-century concept of a programmable machine. Key milestones include the first electronic digital computers like the Z3 in the 1940s using vacuum tubes, the transition to smaller, faster transistors in the 1950s, and the development of integrated circuits (microchips) and microprocessors in the 1960s and 1970s, which enabled personal computers and the internet.

        <h2>computer types</h2>
        <p>
            Computers are categorized into types by size, including supercomputers, mainframes, minicomputers, and microcomputers (like desktops, laptops, and smartphones), and by their data handling method as analog, digital, or hybrid. Digital computers are the most common today and work by processing discrete binary data, while analog computers measure physical phenomena, and hybrid computers combine aspects of both.
